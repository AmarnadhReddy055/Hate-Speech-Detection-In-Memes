## Team Members

- **Amarnadh Surasani (20BDS055)**
- **Amar S C (20BDS004)**

## Tools Used

- **Image Feature Extraction:** ResNet-152, a deep convolutional neural network architecture, was used to extract features from images in the dataset.
- **Text Feature Extraction:** BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model was used for extracting features from text data.

## Notebooks Included

- **FeatureMixing.ipynb**: This notebook demonstrates feature mixing techniques for meme detection.
- **ImageFeatures.ipynb**: Extracts features from images in the dataset using ResNet-152.
- **ImageUniModels.ipynb**: Contains models for image classification using extracted image features.
- **Merge_features.ipynb**: Merges extracted features for model training.
- **VisualBERT.ipynb**: Implements VisualBERT model for meme detection, utilizing both image and text features.
- **text_cleaning.ipynb**: Focuses on text preprocessing and cleaning tasks.
